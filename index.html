    <h1>Hi I'm Jake</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my site! I want to show you what I've learned in my time before starting my software engineering boot-camp and provide a window of who I am. There are links to some of the games that I have done code along's too and I eventually plan to modify these and make them more engaging.
